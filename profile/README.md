## Swisstronik Testnet 1.0: Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🔒

Swisstronik Testnet 1.0 introduces a groundbreaking approach to building and deploying encrypted, privacy-preserving smart contracts. With a strong focus on privacy, compatibility, security, and ease of use, this testnet is designed to revolutionize your development experience.

### Core Features of Swisstronik Testnet 1.0

- **Enhanced Privacy with Intel SGX Enclaves**: Unlike conventional blockchain networks, Swisstronik ensures absolute privacy by executing its EVM module within secure Intel SGX enclaves. Validators perform transactions within these enclaves, protecting your data against insider attacks, front-running, and malicious node activities.

- **CometBFT Consensus Algorithm**: Swisstronik Testnet 1.0 employs the CometBFT consensus algorithm, ensuring secure agreement on transaction order and validity among validators. This PoS-based consensus is environmentally friendly.

- **SwisstronikJS Library**: Safeguard data confidentiality using SwisstronikJS library functions like `sendShieldedTransaction` and `sendShieldedQuery`.

- **Faucet:**: Test Swisstronik's features using free SWTR tokens from our testnet [EVM & Cosmos Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.swisstronik.com/). 

- **EVM Compatibility**: Seamlessly migrate Ethereum-based applications and smart contracts to Swisstronik Testnet 1.0, which is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

- **User-Friendly Block Explorers**: Explore the Swisstronik network with our intuitive Cosmos Blockchain Explorer and dedicated EVM Block Explorer.

- **Unencrypted Logs for Smart Contract Testing**: Analyze smart contract events for effective testing.

- **Staking for Validators & Governance**: Secure the network by staking SWTR tokens and participate in protocol upgrades and improvements.

- **Developer Toolset**: Leverage tools like Hardhat, Keplr, ethers.js, web3.js, and Metamask, with comprehensive documentation to support your development journey.
